# FSD Exp2

## Overview
This project is a simple, modern web app built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. It demonstrates how to structure a frontend project, build reusable components, and present a clean user interface that can be extended for real-world use cases.

## What This App Shows
- A clear component structure (`Dashboard`, `AdminPanel`, `LandingPage`)
- Basic layout and styling using `index.css`
- A working Vite + React + TypeScript setup

## How To Run (Step by Step)
1. Install dependencies:
   - `npm install`
2. Start the development server:
   - `npm run dev`
3. Open the local URL shown in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

## Build For Production
1. Create a production build:
   - `npm run build`
2. Preview the build locally:
   - `npm run preview`

## Learning Outcomes
- Understand how Vite sets up a React + TypeScript project
- Learn basic component composition in React
- See a clean folder structure for scalable UI projects
- Practice working with modern frontend tooling (npm scripts, TypeScript config)

## Project Structure (Key Files)
- `src/main.tsx` - App entry point
- `src/App.tsx` - Root component
- `src/components/` - UI components used in the app
- `src/index.css` - Global styles

## Notes
This is a learning-focused project designed to demonstrate structure, clarity, and good frontend practices in a student-friendly way.
